	abstract = {Dashing is a fast and accurate software tool for estimating similarities of genomes or sequencing datasets. It uses the HyperLogLog sketch together with cardinality estimation methods that are specialized for set unions and intersections. Dashing summarizes genomes more rapidly than previous MinHash-based methods while providing greater accuracy across a wide range of input sizes and sketch sizes. It can sketch and calculate pairwise distances for over 87K genomes in 6 minutes. Dashing is open source and available at https://github.com/dnbaker/dashing.},

    abstract = "{The number of genomes (including meta-genomes) is increasing at an accelerating pace. In the near future, we may need to estimate pairwise distances between millions of genomes. Even with the use of cloud computing, very few softwares can perform such estimation.The multi-threaded software BinDash can perform such estimation using only a typical personal laptop. BinDash implemented b-bit one-permutation rolling MinHash with optimal densification, an existing data-mining technique. BinDash empirically outperforms the state-of-the-art software in terms of precision, compression ratio, memory usage and runtime according to our evaluation. Our evaluation is performed with a Dell Inspiron 157 559 Notebook on all bacterial genomes in RefSeq.BinDash is released under the Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/zhaoxiaofei/BinDash.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
