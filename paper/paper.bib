It uses the HyperLogLog sketch together with cardinality estimation methods that are specialized for set unions and intersections. Dashing summarizes genomes more rapidly than previous MinHash-based methods while providing greater accuracy across a wide range of input sizes and sketch sizes. It can sketch and calculate pairwise distances for over 87K genomes in 6 minutes. Dashing is open source and available at https://github.com/dnbaker/dashing.},

BinDash implemented b-bit one-permutation rolling MinHash with optimal densification, an existing data-mining technique. BinDash empirically outperforms the state-of-the-art software in terms of precision, compression ratio, memory usage and runtime according to our evaluation. Our evaluation is performed with a Dell Inspiron 157 559 Notebook on all bacterial genomes in RefSeq.BinDash is released under the Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/zhaoxiaofei/BinDash.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

For each combination of substitution rates and sequence length, 100 data sets were generated for each of 50 trees, for a total of 5,000 replications per condition. Accuracy was measured by two measures of the distance between the true tree and the estimate of the tree, one measure sensitive to accuracy of branch lengths and the other not. The distance-matrix methods (Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining) performed best when they were constrained from estimating negative branch lengths; all comparisons with other methods used this constraint. Parsimony and compatibility had similar results, with compatibility generally inferior; Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining had similar results, with neighbor joining generally slightly inferior. Maximum likelihood was the most successful method overall, although for short sequences Fitch-Margoliash and neighbor joining were sometimes better. Bias of the estimates was inferred by measuring whether the independent estimates of a tree for different data sets were closer to the true tree than to each other. Parsimony and compatibility had particular difficulty with inaccuracy and bias when substitution rates varied among different branches. When rates of evolution varied among different sites, all methods showed signs of inaccuracy and bias.}",
